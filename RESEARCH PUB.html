  <h3><p style="color:red;"><b>STARTING AN OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL:</b></p></h3>
   <p>SOCIAL vs TECHNICAL</p>
    <p>With enough persistence,I did argue,anybody with a mild technical competence and enoguh persisteance<br>could install 
<a href="www.openjournalsystem.com;">Open journal system</a> the software that I'm going to be using in this<br>guide.What takes the time
energy and willpower is to get the social,rather than techniacl aspects sorted.What do I mean by this?<br></p>
<p style="color:orange;"><b>Editorial board</b></p>
<p>The board is absolutely crucial. Academic journals work on a system of academic capital; you need respected<br>
 individuals who are willing to sit on your board, even if they are only lending their name and you end up doing<br>
 most of the legwork. It should only be a matter of time before academics realise that journal brand isn't (or shouldn't be) affiliated<br>
 to publishers, but rather to the academics who choose to endow a journal with their support. Get good people who are respected within your <br>
 discipline(s) and you're on the right track. Here's an example email that I used to ask people to sit on the bord for <a href="www.orbit.com">Orbit.</a>
</p>
<p style="color:orange;"><b>Peer reviewers</b></p>
<p>When the first articles start flooding in, you'll need all the help you can get. These have to be people you can trust to understand the challenges <br>
    you're facing. They need to set the bar high for the first issue while also appreciating the difficulties of attracting the big names to start-up journals.<br>
    Contact people early so that you're ready to go.</p>
<p style="color:orange;"><b>Copy editors and proof readers</b></p>
<p>If you end up doing this job yourself, expect to spend about 16 hours per article, including typesetting (depending on how you do this -- covered later). <br>
   Therefore, get some good people to help you. They should be sensitive to individual style (ie. light-touch editors) but who also will bring some sort of synthesis to the style.
   </p>
<p style="color:orange;"><b>Other decisions</b></p>
<p>You need to make some decisions and take action on the following issues, not all of which I can describe for you:</p>
